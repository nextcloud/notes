## Note attributes

TODO Introduction

| Attribute | Type | Description | since API version |
|:----------|:-----|:-------------------------|:-------------------|
| `content` | string | Notes can contain arbitrary text. Formatting should be done using Markdown, but not every markup can be supported by every client. Therefore, markup should be used with care. | 1.0 |
| `title` | string | The note's title is also used as filename for the note's file. Therefore, some special characters are not allowed here. When saving a title, it is automatically sanitized and the sanitized value is returned. Please be aware to adopt this value in your client. | 1.0 |
| `category` | string | Every note is assigned to a category or is uncategorized. In fact, uncategorized is equal to the empty category. TODO: sub-categories | 1.0 |
| `favorite` | boolean | TODO | 1.0 |
| `modified` | integer | TODO | 1.0 |
