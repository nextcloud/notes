Furthermore, a separate [REST API](https://github.com/nextcloud/notes/blob/master/docs/api/README.md) allows for an easy integration into third-party apps (currently, there are notes apps for [Android](https://github.com/stefan-niedermann/nextcloud-notes), [iOS](https://github.com/owncloud/notes-iOS-App) and the [console](https://git.danielmoch.com/nncli/about) which allow convenient access to your Nextcloud notes).
