The project lacks resources to answer questions regarding general usage and problems occurring from misconfiguration and or improper use. That's why we kindly ask you to following the following guidelines when considering opening an issue.

**Before opening an issue:**

* Please **carefully read the README** and make sure that your question isn't already answered in the documentation.
* Please **review [the configuration methods](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular#configuring-restangular) and [methods description](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular#methods-description)** once more.
* Please **search the existing issue list** to see if there's already an issue **open or closed** that solves your problem.
* Please **search for and/or ask your question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=restangular)**. You will get answers more quickly there than here.
* Please **debug your problem long and hard** enough to make sure the issue is in Restangular and not in your code and/or backend.

**When opening an issue:**

* Please **create a live Plunker** (fork [this Plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/26Heuv5F6hUgxpNWNTee?p=info)) demonstrating the problem, use [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/) or [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) or similar as backend if needed.
* Please **write your issue in a clear and succint manner**, so that all the details of your issue are easy to understand and fully explained.
* Please **enclose your code in [fenced blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/)** for readability.

The maintainers may opt to close issues that don't follow these guidelines.

**Also remember:**

* Pull requests fixing problems are highly appreciated ;)
